# MeTTa List Manipulation Functions

This project provides various utility functions for list manipulation in the **MeTTa** language, including member checking, removing duplicates, reversing, and sorting. These functions can be used to handle basic list operations and are written in a way that makes them easy to understand and modify for your own purposes.

## Overview of Included Operations

### 1. **Member Check**
This function checks whether a specific element is present in a list. It recursively traverses the list and returns `true` if the element is found, or `false` otherwise.

### 2. **Max Value**
A function to find the maximum value in a list. It compares elements recursively and returns the highest value.

### 3. **Pop Operation**
This function removes the first element of a list, similar to the traditional 'pop' operation in many programming languages.

### 4. **Remove Duplicates**
Removes duplicate elements from a list by recursively traversing it and building a new list that excludes repeated elements.

### 5. **List Reversal**
This function reverses the order of elements in a list using recursion.

### 6. **Sorting**
Implements the insertion sort algorithm to sort a list of elements in ascending order.

## Usage

Feel free to use and modify these functions to fit your specific needs. They serve as a foundation for common list operations and can be extended or adjusted depending on the requirements of your project.

## License

This project is open-source. You are free to use, modify, and distribute these functions as needed.
